    <h1>A Little Bit of Lou</h1>
    <p>On March 24th, 1979, the year of our Lord, I was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota on an airforce base to Carlos and Martha Rivera.
    <br>According to one website I visited it was 26.1 degrees that fateful day, snow depth was about 3 inches and the wind speed was an average or 19 mph, or so the website <a href="https://weatherspark.com/h/d/9084/1979/3/24/Historical-Weather-on-Saturday-March-24-1979-in-Fargo-North-Dakota-United-States">Weatherspark.com</a> says. Upon exiting my mother's birth canal the doctor immediately assigned the "male gender" to me, I assume it was because at birth I had a penis, which is usually a sign that the baby is a male, or at least according to un-woke science (knuckle-draggers, SMH).</p>
    <p>We eventually relocated to Chicago, the home of Da Beloved Bears, crooked politicians, gang violence and deep dish pizza (I think I covered all the important aspects of the city).
      <p>My mother was a deeply Christian woman, but prior to her conversion...not so much, but as a child all I remember was church, church, small groups, church, etc...<br>I was raised alongside two sisters and a half brother, there were some good times and there were some bad times and a lot of "eh" in between, blah, blah, blah.</p>
      <p>Fast forward past all my preadolecent and adolecent trials and error, missteps and follies, I eventually got married and had three beautiful daughters. Eventually I would suffer a split in my household followed by a painful divorce and then I met Amber.</p>
      <p>Amber I met on a crappy dating site, Plenty of Fish, I assume she liked me because eventually we'd get married and adopt a dog, Jarvis, and three cats/kittens, Emily, Bjorn and Freyja.</p>
      <p>To be honest I don't know what else to write, I mean, I do, but it would be a long, boring read, so instead here are some photos of when I was a child. My mom only took like 3 photos of me because taking photos of your children is hardwork.</p>
