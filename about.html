    <h1><u>What I Believe</u></h1>

    <p>On this page I will break down my political, religious as well as other miscellaneous beliefs...just because.</p>

    <br>

    <P><b><u>Political Beliefs</u></b></P>
    <ul>
        <li>Individual Freedom</li>
        <li>Limited Goverment</li>
        <li>The Rule of Law</li>
        <li>Peace through Strength</li>
        <li>Fiscal Responsibility</li>
        <li>Free Markets</li>
        <li>Human Dignity</li>
    </ul>

 <p>I am, what some might classify as, a Conservative, in that I believe in the conservation of, not only our Founding Fathers' original beliefs, as documented in the Declaration of Independence, but also the conservation of certain core beliefs which I believe to be the bedrock for a thriving and healthy civilization.</p>
 
 <p>Although we were not founded as a Christian nation, our nation WAS established upon Judeo-Christian principles and values. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights...". This idea was not born out of a vaccuum, it is a fundemental conception of a Biblical worldview. I believe in the conservation and continual prepetuation of this statement. I could elaborate more, but I want to move on to my religous beliefs.</p>

 <br>

    <P><b><u>Religious Beliefs</u></b></P>
    <ul>
        <li>God exists</li>
        <li>Jesus</li>
        <li>Holy Spirit</li>
        <li>The Bible</li>
        <li>The Church</li>
        <li>The Great Commission</li>
    
    </ul>

<h3>God Exists</h3>
<p>I believe that before anything existed, both in the physical and spiritual world, God was and is. God is the one and only necessary being, all things which have been made have been made by him. When God spoke to Moses in the midst of a burning bush He revealed his name as "I Am" or "To Be", or "To Exist". God IS being, He IS life, nothing can exist or have life without God.<br>
I believe that Scripture reveals God is tri-personal in nature and one in being, the three persons of God's being are God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h3>Jesus</h3>
<p>Jesus is the second person of the God-Head, also referred to as the Son of God. I believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary, conceived by the Holy Spirit. He was/is fully God and fully human, he taught, he healed, he was crucified then raised from the dead on the third day for the atonement of our sins and the redemption our souls.</p>

<h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the third person of the God-Head, also referred to as the Comforter/Counselor. The Holy Spirit provides us with wise counsel, convicts us of sin, is the source of revelation, wisdom and power, He guides us in all truth and knowledge, He empowers us with spiritual gifts, He is our mark of adoption, He helps in our weakness and intercedes for us. He sanctifies and enables good fruit in our lives.</p>

<h3>The Bible</h3>
<p>The Bible is a library of 66 books, written by about 40 different authors, spanning 3 continents, over centuries. I believe it is the inspired word of God and inerrent in it's teachings about the nature of God and His will for His people. As a Protestant I believe the Bible is our foundational source for what I believe and should not be altered or added to.</p>

<h3>The Church</h3>
<p>Not the Roman Catholic church.</p>

<h3>The Great Commission</h3>
<p>Jesus called us to go out and make disciples of all the nations. It is calling to "live like Christ, to love like Christ so that the world my know Christ", I stole that from my church's mission statement. </p>
